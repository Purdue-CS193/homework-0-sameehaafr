# Sameeha's First CS193 Homework
## Some of my favorite things about CS193:
- the TA's have recent experience with CS/DS and know what tools can help the students the most/they're also relatable
- the memes on the slide presentations
- welcoming/energetic environment when I enter class and throughout
